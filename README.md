# zero
PyZero is a circuit modeling software that utilizes real opamp data to create more accurate models. The full documentation of zero can be found [here](https://docs.ligo.org/sean-leavey/zero/). 

I wanted a way to fit my experimental coding data so I implemented the following files into pyzero. Eventually, these files will become a permanent part of pyzero!

I also have created a script that simplifies the use of pyzero which can be found [here](https://github.com/ninoc0/zero/blob/main/PyZeroFitting.py) as well as seen in my own modeling processes found [here](https://github.com/ninoc0/PyZero-Modeling).

More information can be found on my [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ninoc0).
